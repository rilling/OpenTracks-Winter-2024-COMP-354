/**
 * Represents a ski lift object at a ski spot/resort.
 * 
 * This class provides functionality to determine whether a user is currently riding the ski lift
 * based on the data collected by a TrackDifferentiate object. It encapsulates information about
 * the ski lift such as its name, number, average speed, and type.
 * 
 * Usage:
 * - Create an instance of SkiLift by providing its name, number, average speed, lift type,
 *   and a TrackDifferentiate object.
 * - Use the isUserRidingSkiLift() method to check if the user is currently riding the ski lift, useful for service functions.
 * 
 * TODO :
 * - Implement some GPX reference for the SkiLift's location, as it's a physical object it should be placed in the map
